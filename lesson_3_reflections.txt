When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    When there are more contributer to a single project other than me.
    They can always create new files and make changes to an existing file.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually... hmm I don't know yet!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

    Fork: To use the stuff of other GitHub user and making my own changes.
    Clone: To copy the repository to the local computer.
    Branches: To create different versions of projects.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It helps to keep track of the path difference b/w local repo.
    and the GitHub. And it is needed to solve any conflicts that
    can occur during collaboration.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    With a little practice nothing will be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly
in master? What benefits does each approach have?

    Making changes that has a huge impact on the project is better done
    in separate branch rather than in master as we dont want to screw
    things up in the master.
