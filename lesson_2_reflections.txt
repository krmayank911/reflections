What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    An empty git repository is created. Now you can create the files
    for your projects.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area is to add files that have changes. Shit that dosent'n
    sounds good.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    I can always check from the pervious version by using git diff
    between working directory and staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    Branches will help in making different version of a same project.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    That was AWESOME.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

    Merging two branches joined two peices of a puzzle together.
    To get the better track to the commits the two branches have we
    can use graphs or diagrams. So it is easy to read and understand.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

    Cons. Manually Merging two branches means there can be a lot of code
    that need to be taken care of which also means a lot of time.
    Pros. Doing automatic merge will reduce efforts and time but
    you can not take those important decisions to be taken by a machine.
