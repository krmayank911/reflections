What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    An empty git repository is created. Now you can create the files
    for your projects.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area is to add files that have changes. Shit that dosent'n
    sounds good.
