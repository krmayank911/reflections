How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Finding bugs will be easy as fuck.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can spot the differences made in the file and will reduce the time
    for completeing the project.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?

    Pros: Your commits are less.
    Cons: You forget to commit to the file.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In multiple files when two files are inter related with each other
    it is more efficient way to keep tracks of the commits.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git logs to see the history of my commits and git diff to compair
    changes done in two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I dont know yet.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For projects with multiple files.
